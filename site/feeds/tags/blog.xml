But I keep wanting to come back to it... so here's one more attempt at it.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;This time, I'm using David Thompson's lovely &lt;a href=&quot;https://dthompson.us/projects/haunt.html&quot;&gt;Haunt&lt;/a&gt; static site generator. It's written in Guile Scheme and has a Markdown reader, so it's both familiar for blogging and eminently hackable. It's already been kinda fun learning what it looks like to write HTML in SXML. Hey, maybe if my blog becomes a fun hacking project it'll get me to write more too!&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;So, here goes. Blog number... 4? 5? Who knows. Maybe this'll be the one that sticks. :)&lt;/p&gt;</content></entry></feed>
